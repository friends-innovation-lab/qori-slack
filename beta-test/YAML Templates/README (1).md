# 🧠 CivicMind YAML Template Library

Welcome to the CivicMind template system — a structured, AI-powered way to accelerate research, synthesis, and sharing directly from Slack.

These YAML files define how CivicMind interprets user input, prompts the AI, and returns structured outputs for your research operations.

## 🧩 What Are YAML Templates?

Each YAML file represents a **research tool or task**, like:

- Interview summaries
- Affinity mapping
- Persona generation
- Journey maps
- Quote extraction
- Executive summaries
- Insight reports
- Usability issue logging
- Design opportunities
- Jobs-to-be-done
- Outcome tracking
- Slide deck outlines
- Stakeholder summaries
- Thematic synthesis

## 🔧 YAML Template Anatomy

Each YAML file contains:

```yaml
id: internal_id
label: Human-friendly name with emoji
description: What this template does
input_type: text | file
input_processing: summarize_if_long (optional)
batch_mode: true (optional)
batch_delimiter: "---" (optional)

prompt: |
  The instructions given to the AI. Can include formatting rules, constraints, tone, etc.

output_format: |
  A structured Markdown-style output that AI should return
```

---

## 🤖 How It Works in Slack

1. 🔁 Researcher runs a command like:
   ```
   /civicmind summarize_interview
   ```
2. 🧠 CivicMind uses the corresponding YAML file (`interview_summary.yaml`)
3. ✨ The AI processes your input based on the prompt + output_format
4. 📄 The result is posted in your Slack thread **and** saved to GitHub
