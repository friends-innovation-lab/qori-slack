## Competitive Landscape

### How VA Compares

| Feature | VA VVC | Teladoc | Amwell | Doxy.me |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| No download required | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| One-click join | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pre-appointment tech check | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Integrated chat support | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Caregiver features | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Accessibility (WCAG AA) | Partial | Partial | Partial | ❌ |

**Competitive Insight:** No major telehealth platform currently excels at accessibility or caregiver support—this represents a differentiation opportunity for VA.

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Current State
- VVC is a separate application from VA.gov and MyHealtheVet
- Authentication requires separate login flow
- Notifications sent through multiple, uncoordinated systems
- Limited data sharing between scheduling and VVC systems

### Target State (2026)
- Unified experience within VA.gov health portal
- Single sign-on with VA.gov credentials
- Consolidated notification system with Veteran preferences
- Real-time technical readiness data available to scheduling and clinical systems

### Key Dependencies
- VA.gov platform modernization timeline
- Identity verification system upgrades (Login.gov integration)
- Notification platform consolidation (VA Notify)
- EHR integration for scheduling data
