# Screen: Artifact Review / Publish

**Route** `/artifacts/:id` · **Purpose**: Read, review, approve, and publish Qori-generated documents without leaving the Workspace.

## Layout (xl)

## Data
Artifact body, citations map, workflow status + history, versions, publication records (per adapter: state, URL, last attempt, error cause), review threads, destination config.

## Interactions
Citation markers ↔ rail (bidirectional highlight); rail entry → EvidenceDrawer; Approve → publish enabled; Publish dialog (destination + visibility consequence); Retry publication (idempotent); Open in GitHub ↗ when published; version rows → read prior versions (Superseded watermark).

## States
Generating (staged stepper full-pane), draft (suggested treatment banner "Not yet reviewed"), needs review, approved, publishing, published, **publication failed** (workflow badge unchanged + red pill + plain cause + Retry; member variant: "ask your administrator"), superseded, archived.

## Breakpoints
xl/lg: two-pane · md/sm: provenance becomes "Citations (14)" tab; review footer sticky; document measure fluid ≥320px.

## A11y
Document is semantic HTML; citations are links with accessible names ("Citation 1: finding — supported by 12 evidence items"); rail `complementary`; status changes announced; publish dialog trap.

## API
`GET /artifacts/:id` (+body, citations, versions), `POST /artifacts/:id/review`, `POST /artifacts/:id/publish`, `POST /artifacts/:id/publish/retry`, version endpoints.

## Unresolved
- Inline tracked edits v1 vs regenerate-only
- Multiple reviewers / approval quorum per org config?


## UX-2 reconciliation addendum
Workspace is the primary reading surface — never force GitHub to read outputs. Margin custody band per section (which canonical evidence it reflects; CA-002 caveat rendered once, quietly). Workflow chip + publication chip separate fields. Actions: review, approve, publish, retry (idempotent), open in GitHub, publication history. "Approved + projection failed" reads as approved with failed external projection. Class: artifact viewer.
