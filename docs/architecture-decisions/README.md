# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Qori-Slack. An ADR is a short markdown file capturing a single architectural decision: what was chosen, what alternatives were considered, and why this option won.

ADRs exist for three reasons:

1. **Future readers can reconstruct intent.** When a government partner's engineering team asks "why did you do it this way," the answer lives in the repo, not in someone's head.
2. **Decisions don't get re-litigated.** Without ADRs, the same question gets asked every six months and re-answered slightly differently each time. ADRs lock the answer until something new prompts a revisit.
3. **Drift becomes visible.** When a future change contradicts an ADR, that contradiction is explicit. Either the ADR gets superseded with a clear rationale, or the change gets reconsidered.

## When to write an ADR

Write one when a decision meets any of these criteria:

- Affects more than one file or service
- Constrains future work (e.g., "we will always do X")
- Was non-obvious — multiple reasonable options existed
- Future-you might forget the reasoning in three months
- Will be questioned by a reviewer (internal or external)

You do not need an ADR for routine implementation choices. The bar is "would a thoughtful engineer joining this codebase wonder why we did this." If yes, ADR.

## Format

Each ADR is a single markdown file named `NNNN-short-slug.md` where `NNNN` is a four-digit sequence number. Numbers don't restart; they grow monotonically.

The file follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR NNNN: [Short title in present tense]

**Status:** [Accepted / Superseded by ADR-XXXX / Deprecated]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision drivers:** [Who or what prompted this — a bug, a partner requirement, an audit finding]

## Context

What's the situation that requires a decision? What constraints are in play? Two to four paragraphs.

## Decision

What did we choose? Single paragraph, plainly stated.

## Alternatives considered

For each alternative we genuinely considered, one paragraph: what it was, why it didn't win.

## Consequences

What this decision means going forward. Both intended (the wins) and potential downsides (what we accept by choosing this).

## References

Links to relevant Slack threads, PRs, related ADRs, or code locations.
```

## Status lifecycle

- **Accepted** — the active decision
- **Superseded by ADR-XXXX** — a later ADR replaces this one; this ADR is kept for history but no longer reflects current architecture
- **Deprecated** — no longer relevant, but kept for history

Never delete an ADR. Even superseded ones are part of the record.

## Numbering

The first ADR is `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md` (meta — the decision to use ADRs at all). Each subsequent decision gets the next number. If two ADRs are written simultaneously and pick the same number, whoever merges last bumps theirs.

## Reading the existing ADRs

Start with `0001` and read forward. The history is itself useful — it shows how thinking on a topic evolved.

### Lessons (informal ADRs from failure modes)

- [L001 — Service queries default to fetching all model attributes](./L001-fetch-all-model-attributes.md) — From the attribute whitelist bug
- [L002 — Parsers require fuzz inputs covering format variations](./L002-parser-fuzz-coverage.md) — From the comma parser bug
- [L003 — End-to-end tests for critical flows, not just per-layer unit tests](./L003-end-to-end-tests.md) — From three rounds of compensation bugs
- [L004 — Cascade contract test suite](./L004-cascade-contract-test-suite.md) — From synthesis bypassing declared consumes blocks; backfill readout/brief/plan
- [L005 — Per-participant pool schemas must include participant field](./L005-per-participant-pool-schema-field.md) — From silent isolation failure in atomic_nugget_detail; enforced by CI
- [L006 — Dynamic block_id for Slack dropdowns with changing options](./L006-dynamic-blockid-for-slack-dropdowns-with-changing-options.md) — From stale session selection on study change; use context-scoped block_id to force fresh state
- [L007 — Backup pg_dump version mismatch + credential leakage](./L007-backup-pg-version-credential-leak.md) — From PG15 client vs PG18 server; DATABASE_URL leaked via execFileSync error messages

The L-prefix distinguishes "lessons" from active design decisions. Lessons capture failure patterns to avoid; decisions document architectural commitments. Both are useful; they serve different purposes.

### Technical Debt

Documented gaps accepted for MVP that require future attention.

- **CMT-1: Actor FK cascade vs audit retention (2026-09-25)** — Comment messages and thread events use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for actor FKs. If an actor is hard-deleted, their authored messages and audit events are also deleted. Current MVP accepts this because actor deletion follows the existing soft-delete operational model (actors are deactivated, not deleted). Future compliance/audit hardening should reconsider actor FK behavior to preserve records while nulling/anonymizing actor identity.
